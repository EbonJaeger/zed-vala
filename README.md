# zed-vala

Vala language support for Zed.

This adds highlighting support, and also hooks up support for [`vala-language-server`](https://github.com/vala-lang/vala-language-server).

The highlighting definitions are based off of the `nvim.treesitter` Neovim extension [Vala defintions](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/blob/master/queries/vala/highlights.scm).
